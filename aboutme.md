### Mission Statement 

CreationHouse, a 501c3 tax-exempt organization, is a large-umbrella organization with multi-faceted objectives. However, the primary vision is simple - create a place-based approach where members of the community can share ideas, build together, and improve themselves and the societal fabric at large. 

Using structured, impact-driven measurement and evaluation, we are spearheading programs that aim to generate both social and economic returns on investment. Starting with simple initiatives, like the Paternal and Maternal fund, as well as the General Wellness Fund, we will build communities from the ground up, while also placing market-rate investments to then feed and expand our social initiatives. We are a bipartisan organization working for the betterment of the public, garnishing cross-sector support to create long lasting social and economic impact.
